    Ever since the first grade, I went to Detroit Edison Public School Academy(DEPSA). When it came to high school, my freshman I went to Renaissance. Once I started my 10th grade
    year, I went to Detroit Edison Public School Academy Early College of Excellence(DEPSA ECE or ECE). Throughout my high school years, I took advantages of opporunities that was presented in front of me. I was inducted into the National Honor Society.
    Also I was given the opportunity to travel to Harvard University and stay there for 6 weeks. While I was there I took two four-credit college classes. Another opporuntity, I was chosen to be a part of Dual Enrollment at the University
    of Michigan-Dearborn. I started doing that in my 11th grade year of high school. All these opporunities I was able to for free or for a fraction of the cost. I graduated with 20 college credits. As of now, I am a sophmore in college. I attend the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
